# Admin Panel with React

# Getting started

## Follow below instructions to setup project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

#### `Clone the repository`

git clone https://github.com/priyankamackwan/Admin-Panel-with-React.git

#### `cd Admin-Panel-with-React`

Switch to the repo folder

#### `npm install`

#### `Use a .env file locally which you can .gitignore`

The way we prefer to manage our Environment Variables on our development machines is using a .env file which gets loaded into our app once and adds any entries in the .env file to the process.env (global object).

Loading your environment variables from a .env file is as easy as "ABC"!

#### `Create .env file`

Create a .env file in the project and insert your key/value pairs in the following format of KEY=VALUE:

`Frontend`: 

    REACT_APP_API_URL='http://react-admin-api.demo.thewebpatriot.co.in'

`backend`: 

    MONGO_USER_NAME=Your username
    MONGO_USER_PASSWORD=Your password
    PORT=4562

Install all the dependencies using composer

#### `npm run start`

Start the local development server. You can now access the server at http://localhost:3000

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
